## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="logo_en.png">

Over the past months, a dedicated team of researchers from the STI and Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases Unit at the Fight Aids Foundation / Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol has worked to transfer their knowledge on epidemiology into clinical solutions for the Covid-19 pandemic. This work, still on-going, is done thanks to the contribution of citizens (channeled through the [#YoMeCorono](https://www.yomecorono.com/) initiative), and of public and private institutions that are gathering forces to find a treatment for SARS-CoV-2. We wish to acknowledge all these contributions, which are making a difference in the fight against the disease. 

This research is to be disseminated by means of its publication in scientific journals. However, we wish to accelerate the spread of results by publishing the papers in [this repository](.).
